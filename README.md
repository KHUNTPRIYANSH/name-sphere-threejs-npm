# Name-Sphere-ThreeJs (threejs package)

Name-Sphere-Three.js is a React component built using Three.js and @react-three/fiber library. It enables you to create captivating word clouds in a sphere shape, adding an interactive and visually appealing element to your web applications.



## How It Works

Name-Sphere-Three.js uses Three.js to create a 3D sphere and position words evenly across its surface. The component leverages @react-three/fiber for rendering 3D graphics in React applications. Users can pass an array of words as props to the NameSphere component, which then generates a word cloud with the specified settings.

## Local Setup & Installation

To install Name Sphere Three.js locally and set up a project using it, follow these steps:

1. **Install Name Sphere Three.js**: Open your terminal and run the following command to install the package:

    ```bash
    npm install name-sphere-threejs
    ```

2. **Import NameSphere Component**: In your React project, import the `NameSphere` component from `"name-sphere-threejs"`:

    ```jsx
    import React from "react";
    import { NameSphere } from "name-sphere-threejs";
    ```

3. **Use NameSphere Component**: Use the `NameSphere` component in your React components as shown in the following example:

    ```jsx
    function App() {
      return (
        <NameSphere
          count={5} // Number of words in each row/column on the sphere
          radius={15} // Radius of the sphere
          words={["word1", "word2", "word3"]} // Array of words to display on the sphere
          color="black" // Default color of words
          hoveredColor="red" // Color of words when hovered
          width={"100%"} // Width of the canvas (you can use units like %, vh, vw, or px)
          height={"100vh"} // Height of the canvas (you can use units like %, vh, vw, or px)
        />
      );
    }

    export default App;
    ```

4. **Customize Props**: Customize the props of the `NameSphere` component as needed to adjust the appearance and behavior of the word cloud.

By following these steps, you'll be able to set up a project using Name Sphere Three.js in your local environment.

## Props

- `count`: Number of words in each row/column on the sphere (default: `5`)
- `radius`: Radius of the sphere (default: `15`)
- `words`: Array of words to display on the sphere (default: `[]`)
- `color`: Default color of words (default: `"black"`)
- `hoveredColor`: Color of words when hovered (default: `"red"`)
- `width`: Width of the canvas (default: `"100%"`)
- `height`: Height of the canvas (default: `"100vh"`)

## Tips

- Experiment with different values for `count` and `radius` to adjust the density and size of the word cloud.
- Use colors that contrast well with the background for better visibility.
- Provide an array of diverse and relevant words for a more engaging word cloud experience.
- Try to keep the number of words in a multiple of 4 to make a good sphere
